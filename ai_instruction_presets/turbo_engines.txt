This vehicle has both turbo and non-turbo engine variants. Turbo engines cost significantly more - filter out non-turbo engines when analyzing turbo engine prices.

When analyzing engine prices, look for terms like "turbo", "turbocharged", "forced induction" in the listings. Exclude any engines that mention "naturally aspirated" or "non-turbo".

For alternators and starters, turbo engines often have different electrical requirements and mounting positions, so prioritize parts specifically listed for turbo variants.
