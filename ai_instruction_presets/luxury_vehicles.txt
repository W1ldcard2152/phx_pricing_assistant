This is a luxury vehicle with premium components that are often more expensive than standard versions.

For headlights: This model has adaptive/LED/HID versions that cost 3x more than standard halogen. Focus on halogen versions for junkyard pricing unless specifically analyzing premium lighting.

For brake components: Look for performance or Brembo brake components on sport/luxury trims. Standard calipers are much cheaper and more appropriate for junkyard analysis.

Exclude any parts labeled as "OEM", "genuine", or "factory original" as these are typically priced for retail market, not junkyard pricing.
